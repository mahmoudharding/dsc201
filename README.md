# Introduction to R and Python for Data Science

This course is designed to develop essential skills in R and Python for students entering the field of data science. It serves as a foundational course for further study in the Data Science Academy.

## Course Overview

Throughout this course, students will learn:

- **Data Types**: Understanding basic and complex data types in R and Python.
- **Data Structures**: Working with arrays, lists, data frames, and other fundamental structures.
- **Control Structures**: Implementing loops, conditionals, and other flow control methods.
- **Good Coding Practices**: Writing clean, efficient, and readable code, with an emphasis on reproducibility.
- **Reproducible Coding**: Using tools and techniques to ensure that analyses and code can be easily replicated.
- **Basic Algorithms**: Introduction to core data science algorithms and their implementations in R and Python.

This course prepares students for more advanced classes within the Data Science Academy that assume prior experience with either R or Python.

## Prerequisites

No prior experience with R or Python is required, but familiarity with basic programming concepts is helpful.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will:
- Be proficient in writing code in both R and Python.
- Understand how to structure and manipulate data in each language.
- Implement basic data science algorithms.
- Follow best practices for coding and reproducibility.
- Apply "data moves," such as filtering, transforming, visualizing, and summarizing, to analyze multivariable datasets.

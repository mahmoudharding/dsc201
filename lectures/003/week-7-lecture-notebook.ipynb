    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "This webpage is called a Jupyter notebook. A notebook is a place to write programs and view their results. We can also to write and format text using markdown. For this class, I encourage the use of notebooks to prototype work. In the future (either later in this class or beyond) you will likely want to write programs designed to run on all by themselves or interactively for end-users. But we generally will skip over that for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for working in notebooks, there are two types of cells (each rectangle containing text or code is called a **cell**): \n",
    "\n",
    " - **code** cells that hold executable code.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **markdown** cells that hold a special kind of text that follows the markdown syntax. To get familiar with the markdown syntax, take a look at this [Markdown Gudie](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Markdown cells (like this one) can be edited by double-clicking on them. After you edit a markdown cell, click the \"Run cell\" button at the top that looks like ▶| or hold down `Shift` + `Return` to confirm any changes. \n",
    "\n",

    "The kernel is a program that executes the code inside your notebook and outputs the results. In the top right of your window, you can see the name (DSC295) and a circle that indicates the status of your kernel. If the circle is empty (⚪), the kernel is idle and ready to execute code. If the circle is filled in(⚫), the kernel is busy running some code. \n",

    "Next to every code cell, you'll see some text that says `In [...]`. Before you run the cell, you'll see `In [ ]`. When the cell is running, you'll see `In [*]`. If you see an asterisk (\\*) next to a cell that doesn't go away, it's likely that the code inside the cell is taking too long to run, and it might be a good time to interrupt the kernel (discussed below). When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like so: `In [1]`. The number corresponds to the order in which you run the cells; so, the first cell you run will show a 1 when it's finished running, the second will show a 2, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may run into problems where your kernel is stuck for an excessive amount of time, your notebook is very slow and unresponsive, or your kernel loses its connection. If this happens, try the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the top of your screen, click **Kernel**, then **Interrupt Kernel**. Trying running your code again.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If that doesn't help, click **Kernel**, then **Restart Kernel**. If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If that doesn't help, restart your server. This is very rarely needed, but it's good to know how to do just in case. First, save your work by clicking **File** at the top left of your screen, then **Save Notebook**. Next, click **File** again and choose **Hub Control Panel** and select **Stop My Server** to shut it down. Then, after a few moments select **Start My Server** to start it back up. Then, navigate back to the notebook you were working on. You'll still have to run your code cells again."

    "## The Bootstrap\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is one of the simplest, yet most powerful methods in all of statistics because it allows us to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by resampling with replacement from the original data, without making strong assumptions about the underlying population. It provides an easy way to get a sense of what might happen if we could repeat an experiment several times. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we resample *with replacement*, each data point in the original dataset has an equal chance of being selected multiple times or not at all in each new sample. By creating many of these resampled datasets, we can calculate the statistic of interest for each one, generating a distribution of those statistics known as the sampling distribution. This approach is particularly useful when the sample size is small or when the theoretical distribution is unknown. The method is powerful because it turns estimates into distributions that can be used to calculate a range of metrics, including standard errors, confidence intervals, and even $p$-values, helping us better understand the reliability of our results.\n",

Conversely, if it does fall within the interval, do you think we could generate a simulation where it falls outside? Explain your reasoning.\n",

[Intro: Bob Dorough]
Three is a magic number
Yes, it is, it's a magic number

[Verse: Bob Dorough]
Somewhere in the ancient mystic trinity
You get three as a magic number
The past and the present and the future
The faith and hope and charity
The heart and the brain and the body
Give you three as a magic number
It takes three legs to make a tripod or to make a table stand
And it takes three wheels to make a vehicle called a tricycle
Every triangle has three corners, every triangle has three sides
No more, no less, you don't have to guess
When it's three, you can see
It's a magic number

[Chorus: Bob Dorough]
A man and a woman had a little baby
Yes, they did
And they had three in the family
That's a magic number

[Refrain: Bob Dorough]
Three, six, nine
Twelve, fifteen, eighteen
Twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-seven
Thirty
(Three, six, nine
Twelve, fifteen, eighteen
Twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-seven
Thirty)


[Interlude: Bob Dorough and (Instructor)]
(Now, multiply backwards from three times ten)
Three times ten is (thirty)
Three times nine is (twenty-seven)
Three times eight is (twenty-four)
Three times seven is (twenty-one)
Three times six is eighteen
Three times five is fifteen
Three times four is twelve
And three times three is nine
And three times two is six
And three times one is three, of course
(Now, dig the pattern once more)

[Refrain: Bob Dorough and (Instructor)]
(Three) Three, six, nine
(Twelve) Twelve, fifteen, eighteen
(Twenty-one) Twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-seven
Thirty
[Interlude: Bob Dorough and (Instructor)]
(Now, multiply from ten, backwards)
Three times ten is (thirty)
Three times nine is twenty-seven
Three times eight is (twenty-four)
Three times seven is (twenty-one)
Three times six is eighteen
Three times five is fifteen
Three times four is twelve
And three times three is nine
And three times two is six
And three times one...
What is it? (Three!)
Yeah, that's a magic number

[Chorus]
A man and a woman had a little baby
Yes, they did
They had three in the family
That's a magic number

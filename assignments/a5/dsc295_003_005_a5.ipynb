If you see an asterisk (\\*) next to a cell that doesn't go away, it's likely that the code inside the cell is taking too long to run, and it might be a good time to interrupt the kernel (discussed below). When a cell is finished running, you'll see a number inside the brackets, like so: `In [1]`. The number corresponds to the order in which you run the cells; so, the first cell you run will show a 1 when it's finished running, the second will show a 2, and so on. \n",

First, save your work by clicking **File** at the top left of your screen, then **Save Notebook**. Next, click **File** again and choose **Hub Control Panel** and select **Stop My Server** to shut it down. Then, after a few moments select **Start My Server** to start it back up.

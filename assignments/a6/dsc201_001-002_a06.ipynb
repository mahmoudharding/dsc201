To get familiar with the markdown syntax, take a look at this [Markdown Gudie](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Markdown cells (like this one) can be edited by double-clicking on them. After you edit a markdown cell, click the \"Run cell\" button at the top that looks like ▶| or hold down `Shift` + `Return` to confirm any changes. \n",

    "\n",
    "The two building blocks of Python code are *expressions* and *statements*. An **expression** is a piece of code that\n",
    "\n",
    "* is self-contained, meaning it would make sense to write it on a line by itself, and\n",
    "* usually evaluates to a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two expressions that both evaluate to 3\n",
    "\n",
    "* `3`\n",
    "* `5-2`\n",
    "    \n",
    "One important type of expression is the **call expression**. A call expression begins with the name of a function and is followed by the argument(s) of that function in parentheses. The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Description                                                   |\n",
    "|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `abs`    | Returns the absolute value of its argument                    |\n",
    "| `max`    | Returns the maximum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `min`    | Returns the minimum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `pow`    | Raises its first argument to the power of its second argument |\n",
    "| `round`  | Rounds its argument to the nearest integer                    |\n",

    "\n",
    "The expression `5-2` and the two call expressions given above are examples of **compound expressions**, meaning that they are actually combinations of several smaller expressions. `5-2` combines the expressions `5` and `2` by subtraction.  In this case, `5` and `2` are called **subexpressions** because they're expressions that are part of a larger expression.\n",

    "A **statement** is a whole line of code.  Some statements are just expressions.  The expressions listed above are examples.\n",

    "Other statements *make something happen* rather than *having a value*. For example, an **assignment statement** assigns a value to a name. In R we learned that assignment could be done using `<-` or `=`. In Python we will only be using `=`.\n",

Each series, including the national trend, occupational sectors, and sub-national geographies, is seasonally adjusted separately. Indeed switched to this new methodology in January 2021 and now reports all historical data using this new methodology. Historical numbers have been revised and may differ significantly from originally reported values. The new methodology applies a detrended seasonal adjustment factor to the percentage change in job postings.

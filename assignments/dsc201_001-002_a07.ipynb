    "We are publishing [datasets we developed as part of our efforts with Microsoft’s Airband Initiative to help close the rural broadband gap](https://github.com/microsoft/USBroadbandUsagePercentages?tab=readme-ov-file). The data can be used for the purpose of analyzing, understanding, improving, or addressing problems related to broadband access.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets consist of data derived from anonymized data Microsoft collects as part of our ongoing work to improve the performance and security of our software and services. The data does not include any PII information including IP Address. We also suppress any location with less than 20 devices. Other than the aggregated data shared in this data table, no other data is stored during this process. We estimate broadband usage by combining data from multiple Microsoft services. The data from these services are combined with the number of households per county and zip code. Every time a device receives an update or connects to a Microsoft service, we can estimate the throughput speed of a machine. We know the size of the package sent to the computer, and we know the total time of the download. We also determine zip code level location data via reverse IP. Therefore, we can count the number of devices that have connected to the internet at broadband speed per each zip code based on the FCC’s definition of broadband that is 25mbps per download. Using this method, we estimate that ~120.4 million people in the United States are not using the internet at broadband speeds.\n",
